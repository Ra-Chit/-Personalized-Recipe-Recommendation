# Dish-Recommendation-

 This code allows users to input a list of ingredients, a desired flavor profile, and a desired diet. Based on these inputs, the code filters and ranks a dataset of Indian food recipes. It then provides personalized recommendations by considering the relevance score of each dish. The code also includes data preprocessing steps to handle missing values and normalize the data. Finally, it displays the top recommended dishes along with their relevant details such as ingredients, preparation time, cooking time, flavor profile, diet, course, state, and region.
